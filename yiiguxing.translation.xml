      <item value="Helper class that simplifies Redis data access code. &lt;p&gt; Performs automatic serializationdeserialization between the given objects and the underlying binary data in the Redis store. By default, it uses Java serialization for its objects (through {@link JdkSerializationRedisSerializer} ). For String intensive operations consider the dedicated {@link StringRedisTemplate}. &lt;p&gt; The central method is execute, supporting Redis access code implementing the {@link RedisCallback} interface. It provides {@link RedisConnection} handling such that neither the {@link RedisCallback} implementation nor the calling code needs to explicitly care about retrievingclosing Redis connections, or handling Connection lifecycle exceptions. For typical single step actions, there are various convenience methods. &lt;p&gt; Once configured, this class is thread-safe. &lt;p&gt; Note that while the template is generified, it is up to the serializersdeserializers to properly convert the given Objects to and from binary data. &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;This is the central class in Redis support&lt;b&gt;." />
      <item value="Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression for computing the key dynamically. Default is &quot;&quot;, meaning all method parameters are considered as a key, unless a custom keyGenerator has been set. The SpEL expression evaluates against a dedicated context that provides the following meta-data: result for a reference to the result of the method invocation. For supported wrappers such as Optional, result refers to the actual object, not the wrapper root.method, root.target, and root.caches for references to the method, target object, and affected cache(s) respectively. Shortcuts for the method name (root.methodName) and target class (root.targetClass) are also available. Method arguments can be accessed by index. For instance the second argument can be accessed via root.args[1], p1 or a1. Arguments can also be accessed by name if that information is available." />

      <item value="The name of a factory method to use to create this object. Use constructor-arg elements to specify arguments to the factory method, if it takes arguments. Autowiring does not apply to factory methods. If the &quot;class&quot; attribute is present, the factory method will be a static method on the class specified by the &quot;class&quot; attribute on this bean definition. Often this will be the same class as that of the constructed object - for example, when the factory method is used as an alternative to a constructor. However, it may be on a different class. In that case, the created object will not be of the class specified in the &quot;class&quot; attribute. This is analogous to FactoryBean behavior. If the &quot;factory-bean&quot; attribute is present, the &quot;class&quot; attribute is not used, and the factory method will be an instance method on the object returned from a getBean call with the specified bean name. The factory bean may be defined as a singleton or a prototype. The factory method can have any number of arguments. Autowiring is not supported. Use indexed constructor-arg elements in conjunction with the factory-method attribute. Setter Injection can be used in conjunction with a factory method. Method Injection cannot, as the factory method returns an instance, which will be used when the container creates the bean." />
      <item value="The name of the custom destroy method to invoke on bean factory shutdown. The method must have no arguments, but may throw any exception. This is an alternative to implementing Spring's DisposableBean interface or the standard Java CloseableAutoCloseable interface, or marking a method with the PreDestroy annotation. Note: Only invoked on beans whose lifecycle is under the full control of the factory - which is always the case for singletons, but not guaranteed for any other scope." />
      <item value="Can be used to create one or more aliases illegal in an (XML) id. Multiple aliases can be separated by any number of spaces, commas, or semi-colons (or indeed any mixture of the three)." />
